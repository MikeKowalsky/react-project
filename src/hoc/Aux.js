// import React from 'react';
// we don't even need import react

const aux = (props) => props.children;

// it does only one thnig, retourning something 
// what is passed between open end close tag ==> props.childern does that

export default aux;


// it can be usefull also when we are useing flexbox and this additional div
// that should be there (in Cockpit) to wrap h1, p, button can be bad for us
